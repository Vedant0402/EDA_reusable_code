# EDA-reusable_code

#### Just a practice repo for EDA.
#### Writing some code everyday for learning and practicing EDA techniques.


#### Goal -->

#### 1. Perform end-to-end EDA on any dataset.
#### 2. Handle missing data, outliers, skewness, correlations, and feature relationships.
#### 3. Visualize and interpret statistical + business insights with precision.
#### 4. Write clean, professional, and reusable EDA notebooks.

# 10 Days of EDA Mastery Bootcamp (Python + Seaborn)

Welcome to my **10-Day EDA Mastery Bootcamp** — a hands-on journey to mastering **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Over 10 days, I practiced data profiling, visualization, correlation analysis, feature engineering, and automated report generation — building strong analytical intuition step by step.

## 🧾 Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the **foundation of every data science project**.  
The goal of this bootcamp was to:
- Understand dataset structures
- Detect and treat missing values & outliers
- Visualize data relationships
- Engineer new meaningful features
- Summarize insights and generate auto-EDA reports

Each day built upon the previous one, making the learning experience progressive, hands-on, and real-world ready.
